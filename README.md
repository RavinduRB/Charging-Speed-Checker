# Charging Speed Checker

After a long time, I was able to create a new application üòéüöÄ. So I was able to create a charging speed checker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Here the battery level shows the current battery level. This is always updated. Also, when it is not plugged in, it shows as "Disconnected" and when it is plugged in, it shows as "Charging". Charge speed shows how many units are charged per minute. Finally, the time taken to fully charge is displayed in minutes.

I‚Äôll walk through creating the **Charging Speed Checker** based on the functional and non-functional requirements outlined. The implementation includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will use some advanced JavaScript features such as the Battery Status API and `localStorage` for user preferences.

Here‚Äôs how I'll structure the solution:

### 1. **HTML** - To provide the UI structure.
### 2. **CSS** - To style the app, ensure responsive design, and provide dark mode support.
### 3. **JavaScript** - To implement the core functionality, like charging speed, battery status detection, notifications, and real-time updates.

Let‚Äôs start coding the foundational version of the **Charging Speed Checker**:

### **HTML** (index.html)

}
```

### **JavaScript** (script.js)

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  const batteryLevelElement = document.getElementById('battery-level');
  const batteryBarInner = document.getElementById('battery-bar-inner');
  const chargingStatusElement = document.getElementById('charging-status');
  const chargingSpeedElement = document.getElementById('charging-speed');
  const timeUntilFullElement = document.getElementById('time-until-full');
  const darkModeSwitch = document.getElementById('dark-mode-switch');

  let previousBatteryLevel = null;
  let chargingSpeed = null;

  // Load dark mode preference from localStorage
  const isDarkMode = localStorage.getItem('darkMode') === 'true';
  document.body.classList.toggle('dark', isDarkMode);
  darkModeSwitch.checked = isDarkMode;

  // Dark mode toggle event
  darkModeSwitch.addEventListener('change', () => {
    const darkModeEnabled = darkModeSwitch.checked;
    document.body.classList.toggle('dark', darkModeEnabled);
    localStorage.setItem('darkMode', darkModeEnabled);
  });

  // Battery API
  if ('getBattery' in navigator) {
    navigator.getBattery().then((battery) => {
      // Initial battery level and status
      updateBatteryStatus(battery);
      updateChargingSpeed(battery);

      // Event listeners for changes in battery state
      battery.addEventListener('levelchange', () => {
        updateBatteryStatus(battery);
        updateChargingSpeed(battery);
      });
      battery.addEventListener('chargingchange', () => {
        updateBatteryStatus(battery);
        updateChargingSpeed(battery);
      });
    });
  } else {
    alert("Battery API not supported by your browser.");
  }

  function updateBatteryStatus(battery) {
    const level = battery.level * 100;
    batteryLevelElement.textContent = Math.round(level);
    batteryBarInner.style.width = `${level}%`;

    chargingStatusElement.textContent = battery.charging
      ? "Status: Charging"
      : "Status: Disconnected";
  }

  function updateChargingSpeed(battery) {
    if (previousBatteryLevel !== null && battery.charging) {
      const currentBatteryLevel = battery.level * 100;
      const speed = currentBatteryLevel - previousBatteryLevel;

      chargingSpeed = speed;  // Update global charging speed variable
      chargingSpeedElement.textContent = speed.toFixed(2);

      // Estimate time remaining to full charge
      const timeRemaining = (100 - currentBatteryLevel) / speed;
      timeUntilFullElement.textContent = `${timeRemaining.toFixed(2)} minutes`;
    }

    previousBatteryLevel = battery.level * 100;
  }
});
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **HTML**:
   - Contains the basic structure of the Charging Speed Checker. Elements like the battery level, charging speed, and time estimates are displayed in a clean interface.
   - There‚Äôs a dark mode switch that the user can toggle.

2. **CSS**:
   - Implements a clean, responsive layout.
   - Provides a light and dark theme with transitions and ensures readability across both.
   - The progress bar (`battery-bar-inner`) dynamically reflects the current battery level with smooth transitions.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - **Battery Status API**: Retrieves and listens to changes in the battery status (charging state, battery level) and updates the UI in real-time.
   - **Charging Speed Calculation**: Calculates how fast the battery is charging in percentage points per minute.
   - **Time Estimate**: Estimates the time required to fully charge the battery based on the current charging speed.
   - **Dark Mode Toggle**: Allows the user to switch between dark and light mode, with preferences saved to `localStorage` so the setting persists across sessions.

### **Next Steps for Advanced Features:**
1. **Notifications**: Use the browser's Notification API to alert users when the battery is fully charged or charging speed is abnormal.
2. **PWA Support**: Convert this app into a Progressive Web App (PWA) by adding a service worker and web manifest for offline support and "Add to Home Screen" functionality.
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensure proper functionality across multiple devices (mobile, desktop) and browsers.

This is a functional, minimalist version. You can expand on it to meet the full list of non-functional requirements, such as improved performance, accessibility, and security features. Let me know if you‚Äôd like further enhancements!

### Key Features:

1. **Bubbling Background Animation**:
   - Light mode uses a soft bubble effect with lighter colors.
   - Dark mode uses a darker bubble effect to match the theme.

2. **Dynamic Mode Switching**:
   - The background animation changes seamlessly when switching between light and dark modes.

3. **Eye-Comfortable Colors**:
   - Both themes use colors that are easy on the eyes, ensuring a pleasant user experience.

With these updates, your Charging Speed Checker application should now have the desired bubbling background animation and theme switching functionality. Let me know if you need further adjustments or enhancements!
